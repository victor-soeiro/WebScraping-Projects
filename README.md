WebScraping-Projects
====================

Introduction
------------

Over the years, WebScraping became a personal hobby to me, a fun challenge to practice my skills. Most of the code and data are not on GitHub, so I will organize and distribute here and on Kaggle (only the data) for research purposes for the general public.

> **Disclaimer:** This is a personal project to practice webscraping skills and exploratory data analysis. I do not recommend to use for other purposes. Use it at your own risk.
