WebScraping-Projects
====================

Introduction
------------

Over the years Web Scraping has become a personal hobby, a kind of challenge to practice my skills. Most of the projects done in this period were not distributed to the general public, so I decided to organize and publish them here on GitHub and the data on Kaggle.

The interest in Data Science encouraged me to use Web Scraping to analyze some data I was interested in, such as games and anime.

This repository will contain the code used for the data distributed in Kaggle, and also a step-by-step explanation of the process. Have fun with me as I venture into various sites with unstructured data.

> **Disclaimer:** This repository is a personal project distributed under an MIT license to practice Web Scraping, distributing free data for people to do exploratory data analysis. I do not recommend using it for other purposes. Use at your own risk.
    
Tools
-----

I exclusively use Python and some of its packages, like:

* BeautifulSoup
* Requests
* CloudScraper

Remember, respect the request limit of the site to not cause any harm.
