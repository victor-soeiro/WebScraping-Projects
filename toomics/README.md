Toomics - WebScraping Project
==============================

Introduction
------------

Toomics is a premium subscription webtoon service with exclusive titles from professional artists. Following the other webscraping projects, as Tapas and Anime-Planet, this projects aims to scrape the webtoons available on [Toomics](https://toomics.com/). The data will be stored on a CSV file, and available on GitHub and Kaggle for research purposes.

> **Disclaimer:** This is a personal project to practice webscraping skills and exploratory data analysis. I do not recommend to use for other purposes. Use it at your own risk.
